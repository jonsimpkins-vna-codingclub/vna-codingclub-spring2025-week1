First off: **Welcome Back**

As a quick overview to how this setup will work:

* Instructions will be on the left here
* You can run your code (and see output / errors / success) on the right

## How to Log Values

If you want to write some value to the Output logs on the right, you
can use the `log()` method. For example:

```
log("foo");
log(99 + 2)
```

would write

```
foo
101
```

to the output console.

> **CHALLENGE**: Update the `step0()` method in `step_0.js` to log a message with the word "hello" in it.

Alright, now for a quick refresher on arrays.

## Arrays

When we want to store "a list of things in a particular order",
the variable type we use is an **Array**. In Javascript, an array
is written as a comma-separate list of things, with `[` and `]` at
either end:

```
let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
let otherArray = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'];
```

You can grab the length of the array with the `.length` property,
and you can grab items out of the array by specifying the 0-based
"index" of the item. As an example, the code:

```
let someGroceries = ['apple', 'orange', 'cherry'];

log('Number of groceries:');
log(someGroceries.length);

log('Middle item in list:');
log(someGroceries[1]);
```

will log

```
Number of grocieries:
3
Middle item in list:
orange
```

> **CHALLENGE**: Update the `step1()` method in `step_1.js` to log the first and last elements of
the list provided to the function (it'll be a random list every time).

Time to review boolean logic and for loops!

## Boolean Logic

A `boolean` is a type of value that represents something that is `true` or `false`. The 6 boolean
operators we covered in the fall were:

* `==` - this checks if two elements are equal to each other
* `<` and `>` - these check if one element is greater than another
* `<=` and `>=` - these check if one element is greater than **or equal to** another
* `!` - this is the `negation` operator, it takes a true or false value and flips it to the opposite

As an example:

```
let a = 5;
let b = 5;
let c = 100;

let value1 = (a == b) // true
let value2 = (a < b) // false
let value3 = (b >= a) // true
let value4 = !(a == c) // true
```

> **PAUSE**: Does it make sense why `value4` is `true`? It's because `a == c` is false, but the `!`
in front then gives you the opposite of false, which is `true`.

You can also use `&&` (and) and `||` (or) to combine boolean values together. For example:

```
function isNumberPrimeLessThan10(myNumber) {
    if (!(myNumber > 0 && myNumber <= 9)) {
        // Number is outside the range of 1-9
        return false;
    }

    return (myNumber == 2 || myNumber == 3 || myNumber == 5 || myNumber == 7);
}
```

## For Loops

A for loop is a way to repeat code a certain number of times, where each time the code executes,
it knows which iteration it's on. An example would be:

```
for (let i = 3; i < 7; i++) {
    log(2 * i);
}
```

In this example:
* `let i = 3` - this says that `i` is going to be the name of the variable keeping track of which
iteration we're on, and we'll start with `i` being equal to `3`
* `i < 7` - this says that as long as `i` is less than `7`, we keep looping
* `i++` - this say that after every loop, we'll increase the value of `i` by one

The above for loop code would log:

```
6
8
10
12
```

> **PAUSE**: Does it make sense why the value `14` is never logged? It's because `i < 7` does not hold
true when `i` is equal to 7, so the code inside the for loop doesn't run when we get up that high.

## Putting it Together

For the Step 2 challenge, we'll give you an array containing 1000 votes for what type of pizza we should
get, and you'll need to:

* Implement a method `isVoteForPineapple()` to figure out if a specific vote is for pineapple or not
* Use that method to count up how many pineapple votes

If you need to review any information about arrays, feel free to go back to the Step 1 instructions
by clicking the "<-" button up at the top of this panel.

> **CHALLENGE**: Update the `step2()` method in `step_2.js` to tally up the number of votes for
pineapple pizza and log the count of those votes.

# Step 3

And finally a new topic: maps.

## Maps

A `Map` (also sometimes called a "dictionary" in certain programming languages) is a way to store
a bunch of different values each by name, and be able to fetch values very quickly. For example,
you could use a Map to store phone numbers, organized by each persons name:

```
let phoneBookMap = new Map();
let phoneBookMap.set('Jon', 1234567);
let phoneBookMap.set('Susie', 9876543);

let susiePhoneNumber = phoneBookMap.get('Susie'); // 9876543
let doWeHaveBobsNumber = phoneBookMap.has('Bob'); // false
```

In the above example:
* `new Map()` - this is how we create a new empty map
* `.set('Jon', 1234567)` - this is how we put the value `1234567` into the map, under the "key" of `'Jon'`
(the "key" is how we can retrieve this value later)
* `.get('Susie')` - this is how we can retrieve a value that we put in the map previously
* `.has('Bob')` - this is how we can see if the map already contains a value for a particular key

> **CHALLENGE**: Update the `step3()` method in `step_3.js` to tally up the number of votes for
each type of pizza and log the count of **all** those votes.
